Celo Health Recruitment Challenge Testing Docs

I took part in the Celo Health recruitment process for a Junior Test Analyst.
I was successful in the first few rounds of the application, however was ultimately declined at the final stages of recruitment.
Despite being unsuccessful, the process was invaluable for my own learning and growth.

I learnt a lot about testing and it was my first hands-on experience with Selenium.

The initial practical challenge required testing on their staging application, which was conducted with my test script (masterscript.py)
and documented in the pdf file Celo Health QA Practical Assessment Task - RAY HACKSHAW.
